## Description

Shoot a billiard ball at a crowd of other billiard balls in 3D space. The program will simulate the balls colliding and bouncing apart. Collisions conserve momentum, angular momentum and energy. All billiard balls have the same mass and are of uniform density. See the screenshot below.
